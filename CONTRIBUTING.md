- **Be collaborative**: Work together toward consensus

## üèõÔ∏è Governance Model

This project follows **IETF-style governance principles**:

### Community-Driven Development
- **No single entity controls** the standard's future
- **Technical merit** drives decision-making
- **Rough consensus** required for major changes
- **Running code** preferred over theoretical discussions

### Decision-Making Process
1. **Discussion**: Community debate on proposals
2. **Consensus Building**: Working toward agreement
3. **Implementation**: Proving feasibility through code
4. **Adoption**: Real-world validation

### Maintainer Responsibilities
- **Facilitate discussion** and build consensus
- **Review contributions** for technical accuracy
- **Maintain project quality** and consistency
- **Coordinate with standards bodies** (IETF, IANA)

## üîç Review Process

### Pull Request Review
- **Technical accuracy**: Does the contribution improve the standard?
- **Community benefit**: Does it address real-world needs?
- **Specification clarity**: Is it clearly written and unambiguous?
- **Implementation feasibility**: Can it be practically deployed?
- **Security implications**: Does it maintain or improve security?

### Timeline Expectations
- **Initial response**: Within 1 week for most contributions
- **Review process**: 2-4 weeks depending on complexity
- **Major changes**: May require extended discussion period
- **Emergency fixes**: Expedited process for critical issues
