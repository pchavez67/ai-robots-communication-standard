**Date:** August 25, 2025

## **Abstract**

This document specifies the AI Robots Communication Standard, a comprehensive framework for controlling AI agent access to web resources and enabling secure inter-AI communication through airobots.md files. The standard extends beyond traditional web crawling to encompass AI model training, inference, research collaboration, and AI-to-AI communication protocols with built-in security measures. Unlike robots.txt, this standard provides fine-grained permissions, licensing terms, cryptographic authentication, and standardized AI communication mechanisms.

## **Status of This Memo**

This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79\.

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Background**

The exponential growth of AI systems and their data requirements has created new challenges for web resource management and inter-AI coordination. The traditional robots.txt mechanism was designed for simple web crawling in the 1990s and lacks the semantic richness, security features, and flexibility required for modern AI use cases, including:

* Granular permissions for different AI applications (training vs. inference)  
* Secure licensing and compensation frameworks for content usage  
* Real-time AI-to-AI collaboration and resource sharing  
* Cryptographic authentication and secure communication protocols  
* Emergency coordination for AI security threats  
* Dynamic permission negotiation based on verified agent capabilities

### **1.2 Objectives**

This standard aims to:

* Establish standardized and secure AI agent identification and permission protocols  
* Enable fine-grained control over AI access to web resources  
* Facilitate legitimate AI research while respecting content creator rights  
* Create secure, interoperable frameworks for AI-to-AI communication  
* Support economic models for sustainable AI ecosystem development  
* Provide security mechanisms for AI collaboration and threat response

### **1.3 Scope**

This specification covers:

* airobots.md file format and syntax with security extensions  
* Multi-platform discovery mechanisms with integrity verification  
* Permission declaration and cryptographic enforcement  
* Secure AI agent identification and authentication protocols  
* Resource negotiation and access control with audit trails  
* Inter-AI communication standards with encryption requirements  
* Emergency collaboration protocols for security threats  
* Compliance and verification procedures

## **2\. Terminology**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119\.

**AI Agent**: An autonomous software system capable of performing tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence, with cryptographic identity verification.

**AI Resource**: Any computational asset (models, datasets, compute) made available for AI system use under defined security constraints.

**Permission Scope**: The specific use cases, time periods, and security conditions under which access is granted.

**Capability Declaration**: Standardized, cryptographically signed metadata describing an AI agent's functions and limitations.

**Security Emergency**: Critical threat requiring immediate AI collaboration and resource sharing.

## **3\. File Format Specification**

### **3.1 File Location and Discovery**

AI agents MUST follow this discovery priority sequence with integrity verification:

1. **Primary**: `/.well-known/airobots.md` (RFC 8615 Well-Known URIs)  
2. **Secondary**: DNS TXT record lookup for `_airobots.{domain}` with DNSSEC validation  
3. **Fallback**: `/airobots.md` (root directory)  
4. **Legacy**: `/robots.txt` (traditional robots exclusion)

The airobots.md file MUST be served with `Content-Type: text/markdown` and SHOULD include UTF-8 encoding. All files MUST be served over HTTPS with valid certificates.

#### **3.1.1 Well-Known URI Method**

The preferred location is `/.well-known/airobots.md` following RFC 8615:

https://example.com/.well-known/airobots.md

This approach provides:

* Standardized service discovery pattern  
* Platform hosting compatibility  
* Semantic clarity of purpose  
* Security through HTTPS enforcement

#### **3.1.2 DNS TXT Record Discovery**

For platform-agnostic discovery, domains MAY publish DNS TXT records with DNSSEC signing:

\_airobots.example.com. IN TXT "v=airobots1; policy=https://example.com/.well-known/airobots.md; integrity=sha256-abc123...; endpoint=airobots://ai.example.com:8367"

Parameters:

* `v`: Protocol version  
* `policy`: HTTPS URL to airobots.md file  
* `integrity`: SHA-256 hash of the policy file for verification  
* `endpoint`: Optional dedicated AI communication endpoint

#### **3.1.3 Multi-Platform Support**

The specification supports discovery across different platforms with security validation:

Host: example.com

AI-Agent: airobots/1.0

AI-Identity: claude-sonnet-4/anthropic

Authorization: Bearer \<signed-token\>

#### **Secondary Discovery: DNS TXT with DNSSEC**

dig TXT \_airobots.example.com \+dnssec

\# Returns: "v=airobots1; policy=https://example.com/.well-known/airobots.md; integrity=sha256-abc123..."

#### **Resource Catalog Endpoint**

**Security Considerations**

This document introduces security mechanisms designed to protect AI communication infrastructure while enabling legitimate collaboration. Implementers should pay particular attention to:

* Certificate validation and pinning for AI agent authentication  
* End-to-end encryption of sensitive AI collaboration data  
* Audit logging requirements for compliance and incident response  
* Emergency protocols that balance security with rapid threat response  
* Protection against novel attack vectors targeting AI mathematical foundations
